# Setting Up Firestore Security Rules

## Current Status
‚úÖ Firestore Database is enabled
‚úÖ Database location: me-central2
‚è≥ Security rules need to be set

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Click on "Rules" Tab
In the Firestore Database page, you should see multiple tabs at the top:
- **Data** (currently selected - shows "Start collection")
- **Rules** ‚Üê Click this one
- **Usage**
- **Indexes**

### 2. Replace the Default Rules

You'll see a text editor with default rules. Replace ALL of it with this:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Click "Publish"

Look for the "Publish" button (usually blue, in the top right of the rules editor).

### 4. Confirm
You might see a warning about allowing anyone to read/write - that's okay for development/testing. Click "Publish" to confirm.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

These rules allow **ANYONE** to read and write to your database. This is only for **development and testing**.

For production, you'll need to add authentication and proper security rules.
