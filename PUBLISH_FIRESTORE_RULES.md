# Publishing Firestore Security Rules

## ‚ö†Ô∏è You're Seeing the Security Warning - This is Normal!

Firebase is warning you that your security rules allow public access. This is **expected** and **safe** for development.

### Why This is Safe:

1. **Test Data Only** - You're just testing the app
2. **Not Deployed** - Your app is only on your local computer
3. **Your Project Only** - Only affects your Firebase project (tapdine-66c2e)
4. **Can Update Later** - We'll add proper security when you deploy for real users

### What to Do:

1. **Click "Publish"** button (blue button in top right)
2. Confirm if asked: **"Publish"** again
3. Rules will be saved

### You'll See:
- Status: "Rules deployed successfully" ‚úÖ
- Rules are now active

## üéØ Next Step:

After publishing rules, **go to your app** (main.html) and refresh it. Then watch Firestore populate with data as you make reservations!

## üìù For Future Production:

When you're ready to deploy for real users, we'll update the rules to require authentication and restrict access. But for now, this is perfect for testing real-time sync!
