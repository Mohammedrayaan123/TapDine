# Final Test Instructions

## What I Just Fixed

I moved the `firestore` variable to global scope so all functions can access it. This should fix the Firestore initialization.

## Test Now

### 1. Refresh Your App
- Press **Ctrl + Shift + F5** (hard refresh)
- This clears cache and reloads everything

### 2. Check Console

You should now see:
```
üçΩÔ∏è TapDine Professional Reservation System Loading...
‚úÖ Firebase initialized successfully
‚úÖ Firestore initialized          ‚Üê This should appear now!
DOM loaded, initializing system...
```

### 3. Make a Reservation

1. Click any **green table**
2. Fill the form:
   - Name: `John`
   - Phone: `1234567890`
   - Party: `2`
3. Click "Reserve Table"

### 4. Watch the Console

You should see:
```
‚úÖ State saved to Firebase: 22 tables
```

### 5. Check Firestore

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Firestore ‚Üí Data tab
3. You should see:
   - Collection: `restaurants`
   - Document ID: `resto_001`
   - Fields appearing with your data!

### 6. Test Real-time Sync

1. Open **2 browser windows** with your app
2. Window 1: Click any table ‚Üí Reserve it
3. Window 2: Watch the table change to **YELLOW** instantly!
